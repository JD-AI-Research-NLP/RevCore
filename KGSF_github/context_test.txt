Hi , how are you ? _split_ Great , do you have any good comedy suggestions ?
Hi , how are you ? _split_ Great , do you have any good comedy suggestions ? _split_ Sure , there 's @136983 or @174475 or @169487 Sacha Baron Cohen comes to America in the guise of Borat Sagdiyev and wreaks his own brand of Kazakhi _UNK_ . Have you seen any of those ? _split_ @136983 is a classic , i watched it decades ago . Would definitely enjoy anything similar to it . @169487 Sacha Baron Cohen comes to America in the guise of Borat Sagdiyev and wreaks his own brand of Kazakhi _UNK_ i did n't like it , comedy there is vulgar . Have n't seen @174475 , did you like it ?

I would watch @174475 based on your suggestion . I absolutely loved @180437 , story is phenomenal and great humor throughout the film .

I like comedy and action especially @101264 _split_ Have you seen any of the Three _UNK_ Cornetto trilogy ( @182960 , @127115 Hot Fuzz satirizes American action films in a way that an American satire would not . Edgar Wright and Simon , @77666 ) ? They 're delightful combinations of genre satire and genre _UNK_ with tight cinematography and a delightful wit , directed by the person behind @195979 . They 're quite British , but are otherwise extremely distinct and , despite not being connected in terms of story , feel like a _UNK_ series . ( they also have running gags throughout , some of which are things brought up very early in the films and come back as a _UNK_ you 'd almost forget ) _split_ I haven ’ t but I will add them to my list for sure !
